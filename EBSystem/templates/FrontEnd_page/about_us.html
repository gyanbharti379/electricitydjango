            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Electricity Billing System is one of the leading brands in the Indian power sector, promoted by the Rs. 41000 Crore Electricity Group – committed to its mission of transforming life by serving two of the most critical needs - healthcare and power. It is an integrated power utility and is one of the largest private sector players in India having interests in power generation, transmission, distribution and manufacturing and supply of power cables.</p>
            <p>Electricity Billing System foresaw the prospects in the power sector much before the liberalization, when it took-over and successfully turned around an ailing power cable company Mahendra Electricals, renaming it as ‘Electricity Billing System Cables Ltd.’ (now merged with Electricity Billing System Limited w.e.f. 1st April, 2014). The high points of Electricity Billing System’s foray into power however were the acquisitions of two of the India’s oldest utilities – The XYZ Electricity Company Ltd and The ABC Electricity Company Ltd. Electricity Billing System turned them into first rate power utilities, in terms of operational efficiencies and reliability of power supply.</p>
            <p>Electricity Billing System ranks amongst the best run power utilities in the country with highly efficient generation assets. It has a portfolio of coal based, gas based and renewable power plants with an aggregate generation capacity of 4328 MW. The gas based plants of the Company possess greater environmental value with state of the art technology and in-built efficiency enhancing design features.</p>
            <p>The Company distributes power to over 4.13 million customers annually in its distribution areas of Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat and Dahej SEZ and Dholera SIR (Gujarat), in Bhiwandi, Shil, Mumbra and Kalwa (Maharashtra), Agra (Uttar Pradesh) and in Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu. The T&D loss in license areas of the Company is amongst the lowest in the country. The Company offers highly personalized and innovative customer services that incorporate various convenience features.</p>
            <p>Electricity Billing System created history by entering into the country’s first distribution franchisee agreement with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited for Bhiwandi Circle in December 2006. In 2009 it was awarded the distribution franchise for Agra in Uttar Pradesh. The significant reduction in AT&C losses in both Bhiwandi and Agra is a testimony of Company’s operational efficiency. During FY 19 the Company was awarded distribution license for Dholera Special Investment Region (Gujarat) and distribution franchise for Shil, Mumbra & Kalwa (SMK) area (Maharashtra).In FY 21 Electricity Billing System emerged as a successful bidder for 51% stake in licensed distribution operations in Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu.</p>
            <p>From establishing a prominent presence in the generation sector through thermal and renewable generation - to creating a link to the distribution utilities through an effective transmission network - to reaching the end consumer with uninterrupted power supply and 24X7 customer care initiatives through its distribution network, Electricity Billing System has proven its mettle as an integrated power utility.</p>
            <p>The Company is likewise committed to the cause of social service and is repeatedly channelizing a part of its resources and activities, such that it positively affects the society. As a part of its CSR initiatives, the Company makes concentrated efforts in the fields of Community Healthcare, Sanitation & Hygiene, Education & Knowledge Enhancement and Social Care & Concern.</p>
